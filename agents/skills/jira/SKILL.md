<auth>
Token lives at ~/.secrets/jira-api-token (agenix). The helper reads it directly. Raw jira-cli reads JIRA_API_TOKEN from the environment. Config: ~/.config/.jira/.config.yml. Auth type: `basic` (email + API token).
</auth>

<helper_script>
scripts/jira-helper.py wraps jira-cli with --no-input and --plain. Run `--help` for subcommands. Prefer the helper; fall back to jira-cli for interactive workflows or unsupported JQL.
</helper_script>

<non_interactive_trap>
jira-cli prompts interactively by default and hangs in non-interactive contexts. Always pass `--no-input` when running from scripts or agents. The helper does this automatically.
</non_interactive_trap>

<filter_negation>
Negate filters with tilde prefix: `-s~Done` means "not Done", `-ax` means unassigned. This is non-obvious and not in --help.
</filter_negation>

<batch_update_spam>
Use `--skip-notify` when editing multiple issues to avoid flooding team inboxes. Without it, each edit sends a Jira notification.
</batch_update_spam>

<worklog_timezone>
Worklog entries default to server timezone. Always pass `--timezone` when logging time for users in different timezones, or the hours land on the wrong day.
